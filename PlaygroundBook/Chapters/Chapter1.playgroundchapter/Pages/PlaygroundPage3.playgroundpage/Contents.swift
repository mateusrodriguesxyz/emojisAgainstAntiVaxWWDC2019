 ##The Anti-Vax Movement
 
 Vaccines are one of the greatest achievements of medicine but unfortunately there is a growing movement of people standing against vaccination because of misinformation. Let's break some of these myths!
 
 
 - Experiment:
 It's Immunization Day, so let's vaccinate a few emojis.
 1. Click on "Run My Code",
 2. Click on emojis to vaccinate them
 3. Some may cry a little or get a little sick but in the end everyone will be healthy and happy. ðŸ˜€
