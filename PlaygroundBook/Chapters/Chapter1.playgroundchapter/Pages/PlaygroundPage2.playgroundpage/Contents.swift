 ## The immune system
 In simple words, our immune system produces several types of cells responsible for defending our body and two of these very important cells are **B lymphocytes** and **T lymphocytes**. T lymphocytes are responsible for identifying intruders, called **antigens**, and then alerting B lymphocytes which produce **antibodies** to each specific antigen.
 
 ## Vaccines
As some diseases are really dangerous, it is possible to induce the production of antibodies using **vaccines** to inject **dead** or **weakened** antigens into the body. These antigens will not cause the disease but will leave the body prepared for a real attack!

    3. Select **start()** function,
    2. Click on _Run my code_,
    3. Click on the antygen ü¶† so the T lymphcytes can identify it,
    3. The B lymphocytes will produce antibodies üíÇ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è to destroy the antygen!
