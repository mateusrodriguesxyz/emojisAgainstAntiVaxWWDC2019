 ## About Me
 
 Hi, I'm **Mateus Rodrigues**, a **Computer Engineering** student at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Ceara (**IFCE**), in Brazil.
 
 
 I've been a student research at the **Apple Developer Academy - IFCE** since February 2018, when I had my first contact with iOS developement and Swift language.
 
 
 I love keeping up to date on global news on sites like BBC and El Pais, and one of the issues that caught my attention recently was the growth of the Anti-Vax movement and so I decided to talk about vaccines in my playground book for WDDC scholarship.
